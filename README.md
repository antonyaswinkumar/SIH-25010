## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

- Predictive weather alerts and irrigation planning<b>
- Pest and disease detection via image uploads<b>
- Real-time mandi price tracking<b>
- Voice-based interaction in regional languages<b>
- Feedback loop for continuous model improvement<b>
</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<ul><li>Technologies to Be Used<b>
- AI/ML Models: For crop advisory, pest detection, and predictive analytics<b>
- Mobile App Frameworks: Flutter or React Native for cross-platform support<b>
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS or Azure for scalability and data storage<b>
- Language Processing: NLP models for regional language support<b>
- ImaSIH-25010/Agricultural Advisory System Flowchart.pngge Recognition: TensorFlow or PyTorch for pest/disease detection<b>




## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS<b>
- Availability of open agricultural datasets<b>
- Proven success of ICT-based advisories<b>
Potential Challenges<b>
- Low digital literacy<b>
